# HollowTwitch for Crowd Control

If this is your first time using mods with Hollow Knight, **we recommend using the 1 Click Setup, found in the Crowd Control Desktop Client!** Head to https://crowdcontrol.live/ for more info. 

# Manual Setup
We require the following packages: https://github.com/WarpWorld/HKTwitch - https://github.com/hk-modding/api - https://github.com/fifty-six/HollowKnight.Vasi
* The ``api`` and  ``HollowKnight.Vasi`` should be unzipped into your Steam path to ``Hollow Knight\hollow_knight_Data\Managed\``
   * You can get to your game path by right clicking on the game in Steam > Manage > Brows local files.
* The ``HKTwitch`` mod should be extracted to ``Hollow Knight\hollow_knight_Data\Managed\Mods\``. You may need to make the ``Mods`` directory if it does not exist. 
* **In the Crowd Control Desktop Client, find "Hollow Knight (PC)" and click Start.**
* Launch Hollow Knight and you should see a loading bar, which indicates the mod api is loading.
   * The top left will also show the Modding Api version and Crowd Control mod version.
